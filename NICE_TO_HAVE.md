# Nice-to-Have Improvements

Low-priority improvements identified during code review. None are blocking, but each would improve the project's operational maturity.

## Performance

- **KV caching for project resolution in dispatch worker** — Currently every request queries D1 to resolve the project subdomain. A Cloudflare KV cache with a short TTL (e.g. 60s) would reduce latency and D1 load for hot projects. Requires cache invalidation on project config changes.

## Security

- **Configurable Argon2 params for native deployments** — Current params (4 MiB memory, 2 iterations, 1 lane) are tuned for Cloudflare Workers' constrained environment. Native deployments should use higher cost params (e.g. 64 MiB, 3 iterations) for stronger password hashing. Could be driven by a `ARGON2_MEMORY_COST` env var.

## Testing

- **Code coverage tracking with cargo-tarpaulin** — No coverage metrics are currently tracked. Integrating `cargo-tarpaulin` into CI would identify untested code paths and track coverage trends over time.

- **Multi-browser Playwright matrix** — E2E tests currently run Chrome only. Adding Firefox and Safari (webkit) to the Playwright config would catch browser-specific rendering and API issues.

- **Component-level frontend tests** — Frontend code has no unit tests (only E2E via Playwright). Adding Vitest for Preact component and utility function tests would catch regressions faster and without the overhead of full browser automation.

## Operations

- **Load/performance testing setup** — No load testing exists. A basic k6 or Artillery script targeting auth, storage, and admin endpoints would establish baseline throughput numbers and catch regressions.
