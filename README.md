# Solobase

What if deploying a backend was as simple as running a single file? No Docker containers, no Node.js runtime, no required dependencies - just download and run. Solobase delivers auth, database, storage, UI components, and extension capabilities, all in one single self-contained binary, that you can run in literally seconds. The backend you've been waiting for - powerful enough for production, simple enough for anyone, free from lock-in.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/suppers-ai/solobase/cmd/solobase@latest
```

## Usage

```bash

```

That's it. Really.
