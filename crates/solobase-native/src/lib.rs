//! Native platform services and bootstrap helpers for WAFER-based server
//! apps. Sibling to `solobase-browser`; provides the same shape (factory
//! functions per service, lightweight bootstrap helpers, a runtime /
//! serve layer) so a consumer's entrypoint looks structurally identical
//! across both targets.
//!
//! The library contains zero solobase-app-specific knowledge — app-level
//! schema work (reading/seeding `variables` tables, per-block config
//! JSON, SolobaseBuilder composition) lives in the consumer's binary.
