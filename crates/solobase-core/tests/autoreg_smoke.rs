//! Registration-completeness test for the `feature_block_manifest!` set.
//!
//! S5-V replaced the three hand-synced registration lists (native linkme
//! `register_static_block!`, the wasm32 `register_all_static_blocks` list, and
//! the `all_block_infos` push list) with ONE `(feature, name, constructor)`
//! manifest in `blocks/mod.rs`. This test pins the exact block set the manifest
//! must register, on the host target, so a block silently dropped from the
//! manifest (a missing block at runtime) fails CI here.
//!
//! `register_feature_blocks` is called from `SolobaseBuilder::build()` on BOTH
//! native and wasm32; there is no longer a link-time linkme step, so a bare
//! `Wafer::new()` starts with zero `suppers-ai/*` blocks until the builder runs
//! it — this test drives `register_feature_blocks` directly.
