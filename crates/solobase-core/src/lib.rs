// Exposed to the `tests/` integration-test crates (and any consumer that
// wants the shared `TestContext` harness) behind the `test-support` feature,
// in addition to the crate's own `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests. Gating it on a
// feature — rather than `#[cfg(test)]` only — is what lets the integration
// tests reuse `TestContext` instead of re-implementing it.
