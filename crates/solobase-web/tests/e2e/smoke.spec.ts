  // .controller)` provides the actual assertion timing. Default `load` blocks
  // on every subresource; even `domcontentloaded` is delayed by deferred and
  // module scripts. Neither fires reliably here because the loader page imports
  // `/webllm-engine.js` and `/embed-engine.js` (type="module"), and a slow
  // jsdelivr CDN response for either one used to push the goto past the 60s
  // test timeout. Lazy-loading the WebLLM ESM (see webllm-engine.js) removed
  // most of the slowness, but `commit` is still the semantically correct
  // waitUntil for an SW-registration smoke and survives future regressions.

  // destroy the execution context between a separate `waitForFunction` +
  // `evaluate` pair.

  // in <1s; on a cold CI runner it can take well over 50s before the SW
  // responds to its first fetch. Bump the per-test timeout and the
  // waitForURL timeout so the smoke survives the cold path. Override
