//! Browser platform services + Service-Worker plumbing for WAFER-in-browser
//! applications.
//!
//! This crate is the browser half of Solobase's framework layer. It provides
//! factory functions for platform services (sql.js database, OPFS storage,
//! fetch network, browser crypto, console logger, SW asset loader), an async
//! `db_init` helper, and thread_local SW runtime plumbing
//! (`store_wafer`/`dispatch_request`/`is_initialized`). Consumers compose these
//! in their own `#[wasm_bindgen]` entrypoints using any app-level builder.
//!
//! Native web-bundle tooling (the `sw.js`/`loader.js`/`index.html` templates
//! and the wasm-pack output bundler) lives in the sibling `solobase-bundle`
//! crate, so this crate stays a pure wasm32 cdylib that the native `solobase`
//! CLI never has to compile.

// Pure-Rust modules — available on all targets (native + wasm32).
// openai_codec is pure Rust and tested on native; the rest of `llm` is too
// (stubs today, real impls later behind wasm32 cfg inside the module).

// Pure param/row codec for the sql.js bridge edge — split out of the
// wasm32-only `database` module so it unit-tests on the host. Only consumed by
// the wasm32 `database` module, so it's compiled on wasm32 (real use) or under
// `test` (host unit tests) — not on plain native builds, where it'd be dead.
