// `Cli` bypasses clap's verb-level flag handling, so any new flag added
// to a verb silently defaults to whatever value happens to be in the
// hand-rolled default. The bare-`solobase` fallback in `main` instead
// reparses the synthetic argv `["solobase", "serve"]`, which keeps clap
// as the single source of truth.
