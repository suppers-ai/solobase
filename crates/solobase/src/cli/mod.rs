//! Unified CLI surface.
//!
//! `cli_args` + `mode` define the parser and mode/target detection.
//! `flows` contains the four (mode × target) handlers. `helpers` holds
//! the cross-flow utilities (block discovery, frontend copy, overlay
//! application, wasm resolution, static-file HTTP server). `config` is
//! the `solobase.toml` schema + walk-up loader. `server` + `server_config`
//! carry the in-process native server-boot body, invoked today by the
//! sealed × native flow. `cmd` is the child-process runner used by the
//! flows that shell out (cargo, wasm-pack, wafer).
