//! Per-isolate runtime cache. Builds the Wafer once per isolate (sealed, no
//! boot funnel — migrations/seeds happen at deploy via `/_deploy/init`),
//! stores it in a thread_local, and rebuilds when the KV config-version
//! stamp moves. Mirrors solobase-browser/src/runtime.rs's thread_local
//! pattern; `Rc` handles (not raw pointers) keep an in-flight request's
//! runtime alive across a swap. wasm32 is single-threaded, so the RefCell
//! borrows are never contended — but they are still never held across an
//! `.await` (interleaved fetch events resume at await points).
//!
//! Concurrent first requests may race to build; last store wins. A build
//! is pure CPU plus one KV-cached block_settings read, so a duplicate
//! build is wasteful-but-correct and only possible in the first instants
//! of an isolate's life. (YAGNI: no async build-guard until measurement
//! says otherwise.)
