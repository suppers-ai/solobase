# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The codebase currently suffers from significant type duplication across multiple packages, creating confusion and maintenance overhead. Multiple user-related types exist (UserResponse, AuthUser, User, UsersTable), along with duplicated auth state and session types. This refactoring will establish a single source of truth for all types, with the database schema serving as the canonical definition since it represents the actual stored data structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single source of truth for user types, so that I don't have to maintain multiple conflicting definitions across packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to reference a user type THEN I SHALL use the database-derived type from the shared package
2. WHEN I update user properties THEN I SHALL only need to update the database schema and all dependent types SHALL be automatically consistent
3. WHEN I import user types THEN I SHALL import from a single canonical location in the shared package

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent authentication state management, so that auth-related types are uniform across all packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with authentication state THEN I SHALL use types derived from the database schema
2. WHEN I handle auth sessions THEN I SHALL use consistent session types across all packages
3. WHEN I implement auth flows THEN I SHALL use standardized auth response and error types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant type definitions, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and less prone to inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for duplicate type definitions THEN I SHALL find only one canonical definition per concept
2. WHEN I need to add new user or auth properties THEN I SHALL only need to update the database schema
3. WHEN I refactor types THEN I SHALL ensure all existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type mapping utilities, so that I can easily convert between database types and API response types when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to transform database types for API responses THEN I SHALL use provided utility functions
2. WHEN I need to map between different type representations THEN I SHALL use type-safe conversion utilities
3. WHEN I work with external auth providers THEN I SHALL have utilities to map their responses to our canonical types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility during the migration, so that existing code continues to work while the refactoring is in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I migrate types THEN I SHALL provide deprecated aliases for old type names with clear migration paths
2. WHEN I update imports THEN I SHALL ensure no runtime errors occur during the transition
3. WHEN I complete the migration THEN I SHALL remove deprecated aliases and update all references
