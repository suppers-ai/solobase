# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will ensure the UI Library Showcase Website properly displays and demonstrates ALL available components from the ui-lib package. The website currently has infrastructure for 50+ components across 7 categories (Actions, Display, Navigation, Input, Layout, Feedback, Mockup) but the main components index page only shows a subset. This update will ensure complete coverage and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all available UI library components displayed on the main components page, so that I can quickly browse and understand the complete component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the /components page THEN the system SHALL display all 50+ UI components from all categories (Actions, Display, Navigation, Input, Layout, Feedback, Mockup)
2. WHEN a user views the components grid THEN the system SHALL show each component with a clear title, description, category badge, and working preview
3. WHEN a user scrolls through the page THEN the system SHALL organize components in a responsive grid layout with proper categorization
4. WHEN a user loads the page THEN the system SHALL display component previews using the actual UI library code with realistic examples

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to filter and search through the component library, so that I can quickly find specific components I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on category filters THEN the system SHALL show only components from that category (Actions, Display, Navigation, Input, Layout, Feedback, Mockup)
2. WHEN a user views category filters THEN the system SHALL display accurate component counts for each category
3. WHEN a user selects "All" category THEN the system SHALL display all components with the correct total count
4. WHEN a user interacts with filters THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and smooth transitions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access detailed individual pages for each component, so that I can see comprehensive examples and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a component card THEN the system SHALL navigate to that component's individual showcase page
2. WHEN a user visits an individual component page THEN the system SHALL display multiple variants, states, and configurations of that component
3. WHEN a user views a component page THEN the system SHALL show working interactive examples that demonstrate the component's functionality
4. WHEN a user navigates to any component page THEN the system SHALL ensure all examples render correctly without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see comprehensive examples of all component categories, so that I can understand the full scope of available UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses Action components THEN the system SHALL display all 8 action components (Button, Dropdown, Modal, Swap, Theme Controller, Login Button, Search Button, Search Modal)
2. WHEN a user browses Display components THEN the system SHALL display all 13 display components (Avatar, Badge, Card, Accordion, Carousel, Chat Bubble, Collapse, Countdown, Diff, Kbd, Stat, Table, Timeline)
3. WHEN a user browses Navigation components THEN the system SHALL display all 8 navigation components (Breadcrumbs, Dock, Link, Menu, Navbar, Pagination, Steps, Tabs, User Profile Dropdown)
4. WHEN a user browses Input components THEN the system SHALL display all 17 input components (Checkbox, Input, Select, Textarea, Toggle, Radio, Range, Rating, File Input, Color Input, Date Input, Time Input, Email Input, Password Input, Number Input, Datetime Input, Text Input)
5. WHEN a user browses Layout components THEN the system SHALL display all 9 layout components (Divider, Drawer, Footer, Hero, Indicator, Join, Mask, Stack, Artboard)
6. WHEN a user browses Feedback components THEN the system SHALL display all 7 feedback components (Alert, Loading, Progress, Radial Progress, Skeleton, Toast, Tooltip)
7. WHEN a user browses Mockup components THEN the system SHALL display all 4 mockup components (Browser Mockup, Phone Mockup, Window Mockup, Code Mockup)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see code examples and props documentation for each component, so that I can implement them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a component's individual page THEN the system SHALL display JSX code examples for each variant shown
2. WHEN a user wants to copy code THEN the system SHALL provide copy-to-clipboard functionality for code examples
3. WHEN a user views component documentation THEN the system SHALL show available props, their types, and default values where applicable
4. WHEN a user sees component examples THEN the system SHALL provide realistic, production-ready code snippets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user browsing on different devices, I want the showcase website to work well on mobile and desktop, so that I can view components regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the website on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout that works on small screens
2. WHEN a user navigates on mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure component examples are clearly visible and interactive
3. WHEN a user views the site on desktop THEN the system SHALL make efficient use of screen space to show multiple examples
4. WHEN a user interacts with components THEN the system SHALL ensure buttons and inputs work properly on touch devices
