# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will refactor the ui-lib-website islands and pages sections to better reflect the current architecture where the ui-lib no longer contains islands. Instead, these sections should focus on educating developers about how to create and use islands from the existing components, and how to build complete pages using the component library.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand how to create interactive islands from ui-lib components, so that I can add client-side interactivity to my Fresh applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the /islands page THEN the system SHALL display educational content about creating islands from ui-lib components
2. WHEN a user views island examples THEN the system SHALL show practical examples of converting static components into interactive islands
3. WHEN a user browses island patterns THEN the system SHALL demonstrate common interactivity patterns like state management, event handling, and form interactions
4. WHEN a user views code examples THEN the system SHALL provide complete, working examples that can be copied and used in Fresh applications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see examples of different complexity levels for islands, so that I can understand how to implement both simple and advanced interactive features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views basic island examples THEN the system SHALL show simple interactivity like button clicks and state toggles
2. WHEN a user views medium complexity examples THEN the system SHALL demonstrate form handling, local storage, and component communication
3. WHEN a user views advanced examples THEN the system SHALL show complex patterns like real-time updates, API integration, and multi-component orchestration
4. WHEN a user selects a complexity level THEN the system SHALL filter examples to show only that level of complexity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand how to build complete pages using ui-lib components, so that I can create full applications with consistent design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the /pages section THEN the system SHALL display examples of complete page layouts built with ui-lib components
2. WHEN a user views page examples THEN the system SHALL show different page types like dashboards, forms, landing pages, and admin interfaces
3. WHEN a user examines page structure THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper layout composition, component organization, and responsive design
4. WHEN a user views page code THEN the system SHALL provide complete page implementations that can be used as templates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see how to combine components effectively in page layouts, so that I can create cohesive user interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views layout examples THEN the system SHALL show how to combine navigation, content, and footer components
2. WHEN a user examines component composition THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper nesting, spacing, and alignment of components
3. WHEN a user views responsive examples THEN the system SHALL show how pages adapt to different screen sizes using ui-lib components
4. WHEN a user studies page patterns THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on common UI patterns and best practices

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the relationship between static components and interactive islands, so that I can make informed decisions about when to use each approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads island guidance THEN the system SHALL explain when to use islands vs static components
2. WHEN a user views performance considerations THEN the system SHALL show the impact of client-side hydration and bundle size
3. WHEN a user examines architecture patterns THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper separation between server-side and client-side code
4. WHEN a user studies best practices THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for optimal Fresh application architecture

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see practical examples that I can adapt for my own projects, so that I can quickly implement similar functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any example THEN the system SHALL provide complete, runnable code that works out of the box
2. WHEN a user wants to copy code THEN the system SHALL offer easy copy-to-clipboard functionality for all examples
3. WHEN a user examines examples THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript types and error handling
4. WHEN a user studies implementations THEN the system SHALL provide comments and explanations for complex logic
