# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a simple CDN package that serves common static assets shared across applications in the monorepo. The package will provide a centralized location for shared assets like backgrounds, logos, and favicons, making them easily accessible to all applications without duplication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access shared static assets from a central location, so that I don't need to duplicate common files across multiple applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application requests a shared asset THEN the system SHALL serve the file from the CDN package
2. WHEN serving assets THEN the system SHALL support common image formats (png, jpg, webp, svg, ico)
3. WHEN assets are requested THEN the system SHALL return appropriate MIME types for each file format
4. WHEN assets don't exist THEN the system SHALL return a 404 status code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared assets organized in logical folders, so that I can easily find and reference the assets I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing assets THEN the system SHALL organize files in folders like /logos, /backgrounds, /favicons
2. WHEN requesting assets THEN the system SHALL maintain the folder structure in URL paths
3. WHEN listing available assets THEN the system SHALL provide a clear directory structure
4. WHEN adding new asset types THEN the system SHALL support creating new organized folders

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want assets to be served with proper caching headers, so that applications load faster and reduce bandwidth usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving static assets THEN the system SHALL set appropriate cache-control headers for long-term caching
2. WHEN assets are served THEN the system SHALL include ETag headers for cache validation
3. WHEN clients make conditional requests THEN the system SHALL return 304 Not Modified when appropriate
4. IF assets are updated THEN the system SHALL ensure new versions are served after cache expiration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily integrate the CDN package into my applications, so that I can reference shared assets with minimal setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the package THEN the system SHALL provide a simple import or URL pattern for asset access
2. WHEN applications start THEN the system SHALL be available without complex configuration
3. WHEN referencing assets THEN the system SHALL provide consistent URL patterns across all applications
4. WHEN the package is updated THEN existing applications SHALL continue to work without changes
