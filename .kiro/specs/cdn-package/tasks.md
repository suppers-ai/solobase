# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up CDN package structure and configuration
  - Create the basic package directory structure with deno.json configuration
  - Set up Fresh application entry points (main.ts, dev.ts, mod.ts)
  - Configure package exports and imports following monorepo patterns
  - Add the new package to the workspace configuration in root deno.json
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 2. Create static asset directory structure and sample assets
  - Create organized static asset folders (backgrounds/, logos/, favicons/)
  - Copy existing shared assets from other packages to centralize them
  - Organize assets by type and ensure consistent naming conventions
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Implement core asset handler library
  - Create asset-handler.ts with MIME type detection function
  - Implement cache header generation for different file types
  - Add path validation and security functions to prevent directory traversal
  - Write file serving logic with proper error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Create catch-all route handler for asset serving
  - Implement [...path].ts route handler that processes all asset requests
  - Integrate asset handler library for file serving
  - Add proper HTTP status codes and error responses
  - Implement conditional request handling with ETag support
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Write comprehensive tests for asset serving functionality
  - Create unit tests for asset handler functions (MIME types, cache headers, path validation)
  - Write integration tests for end-to-end asset serving
  - Add tests for error scenarios (404, invalid paths, server errors)
  - Test caching behavior and conditional requests
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Configure development and build tasks
  - Set up development server task with hot reload
  - Add build, test, and lint tasks to package.json
  - Configure Fresh application for optimal static file serving
  - Add package-specific tasks to root workspace configuration
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_
