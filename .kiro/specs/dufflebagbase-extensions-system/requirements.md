# DuffleBagBase Extensions System - Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The DuffleBagBase Extensions System provides a robust plugin architecture that enables third-party developers to extend the core application functionality through a well-defined interface. Unlike traditional runtime plugin systems, this implementation uses compile-time extension inclusion to maintain Go's type safety and single-binary deployment model while providing flexibility for custom functionality.

## Introduction

The extension system addresses the need for customization and extensibility in DuffleBagBase deployments without compromising the simplicity of a single-binary application. Extensions can:

- Add new API endpoints with full routing capabilities
- Extend existing handlers through a comprehensive hook system
- Register custom middleware in the request pipeline
- Integrate seamlessly with authentication, database, storage, and logging services
- Define custom database schemas with migration support
- Configure behavior through validated configuration schemas
- Provide UI components and static assets

The system prioritizes security, performance, and developer experience while maintaining backward compatibility with the core application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Extension Development Interface

**User Story:** As a community developer, I want to create extensions for DuffleBagBase so that I can add custom functionality without modifying the core application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer creates an extension THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized `Extension` interface with clear lifecycle methods (Initialize, Start, Stop)
2. WHEN an extension is created THEN it SHALL be able to define custom API endpoints using the Gorilla Mux router with full HTTP method support
3. WHEN an extension is created THEN it SHALL receive a typed `ExtensionServices` struct providing controlled access to:
   - Database connection (with schema isolation)
   - Authentication service (auth.Service)
   - Storage service (StorageService)
   - Logging service (logger.Logger)
   - Collections service (CollectionsService)
   - Configuration management (config.Config)
4. WHEN an extension is created THEN it SHALL be able to register custom middleware with priority ordering and path-specific application
5. IF an extension has database requirements THEN the system SHALL support:
   - Extension-specific PostgreSQL schemas
   - Versioned migration management
   - Automatic rollback on failure
6. WHEN an extension needs UI components THEN it SHALL be able to register Templ templates and static assets

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DuffleBagBase administrator, I want to enable/disable extensions at runtime so that I can control which functionality is available in my deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extensions are available THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options to enable/disable specific extensions
2. WHEN an extension is disabled THEN its routes and middleware SHALL NOT be registered with the application
3. WHEN extension configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without requiring application restart
4. WHEN extensions are configured THEN the system SHALL validate extension compatibility and dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want extensions to compile into the main binary so that deployment remains simple with a single executable file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN all enabled extensions SHALL be compiled into the single binary
2. WHEN extensions are included THEN the build process SHALL automatically discover and include extension code
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL support conditional compilation of extensions based on build tags
4. WHEN extensions have dependencies THEN the build system SHALL resolve and include all required dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want to extend existing API endpoints so that I can add custom functionality to existing handlers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension wants to extend existing endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide hooks for pre and post-processing
2. WHEN extending endpoints THEN extensions SHALL be able to modify request/response data
3. WHEN multiple extensions extend the same endpoint THEN the system SHALL execute them in a defined order
4. WHEN an extension extends an endpoint THEN it SHALL have access to the same context and services as the original handler

### Requirement 5: Authentication and Authorization Integration

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want to integrate with the existing authentication and authorization system so that my extension respects user permissions and roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension creates protected endpoints THEN it SHALL use the existing authentication middleware from middleware/auth.go
2. WHEN an extension needs role-based access THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing RBAC system supporting roles:
   - `admin` - Full system access
   - `manager` - Management capabilities
   - `user` - Standard user access
   - `deleted` - Deactivated account
   - Custom roles defined by extensions
3. WHEN an extension accesses user data THEN it SHALL:
   - Respect the existing JWT session management
   - Access user context through the standard context.Context pattern
   - Honor cookie-based authentication (auth_token)
4. WHEN an extension performs actions THEN they SHALL:
   - Be logged using the logger.logs table
   - Include appropriate context (user_id, action, metadata)
   - Support audit trail requirements
5. WHEN an extension defines new permissions THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing permission checking system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want extension errors to be handled gracefully so that a faulty extension doesn't crash the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension encounters an error THEN the system SHALL isolate the error and continue operating
2. WHEN an extension fails to load THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without that extension
3. WHEN an extension panics THEN the system SHALL recover and disable the problematic extension
4. WHEN extension errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate context for debugging

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an extension developer, I want to access extension-specific configuration so that my extension can be customized for different deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an extension needs configuration THEN the system SHALL provide a standardized configuration interface
2. WHEN extension configuration is provided THEN it SHALL be validated against the extension's schema
3. WHEN configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN extensions SHALL be able to reload their settings without restart

### Requirement 8: Extension Discovery and Management API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to discover available extensions so that I can understand what functionality is available in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extensions are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/v1/extensions` - List all registered extensions
   - `GET /api/v1/extensions/{name}` - Get specific extension details
   - `POST /api/v1/extensions/{name}/enable` - Enable an extension (admin only)
   - `POST /api/v1/extensions/{name}/disable` - Disable an extension (admin only)
   - `GET /api/v1/extensions/{name}/status` - Get extension health status
2. WHEN querying extensions THEN the system SHALL return:
