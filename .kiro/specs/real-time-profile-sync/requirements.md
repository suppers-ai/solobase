# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current SSO/profile system has a significant UX issue where changes made in the profile application (such as theme changes) are not immediately reflected in the parent application that opened the profile view. Users must sign out and sign back in to see changes, which creates a poor user experience. Additionally, the current "View Profile" functionality opens in a new tab, which feels disconnected from the main application flow.

This feature will implement real-time synchronization between profile changes and parent applications, along with a more natural popup-based profile interface that maintains connection with the parent window.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the docs application, I want to see theme changes immediately when I modify my theme in the profile popup, so that I don't have to refresh or re-authenticate to see my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "View Profile" from any application THEN the system SHALL open a popup window instead of a new tab
2. WHEN I change my theme in the profile popup THEN the parent application SHALL immediately reflect the theme change
3. WHEN I update my profile information in the popup THEN the parent application SHALL immediately update any displayed user information
4. WHEN I close the profile popup THEN the parent application SHALL retain all synchronized changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the profile popup to feel integrated with the main application, so that the experience feels seamless and connected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click "View Profile" THEN the system SHALL open a centered popup window with appropriate dimensions
2. WHEN the profile popup opens THEN it SHALL maintain visual consistency with the parent application's theme
3. WHEN I interact with the profile popup THEN the parent window SHALL remain accessible but slightly dimmed
4. IF the popup is blocked by the browser THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to opening in a new tab

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable real-time synchronization system, so that any application can easily integrate profile change notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data changes in any context THEN the system SHALL broadcast change events to all connected applications
2. WHEN an application receives a profile change event THEN it SHALL update its local state and UI accordingly
3. WHEN multiple applications are open simultaneously THEN all SHALL receive and apply profile changes in real-time
4. WHEN a profile change fails THEN the system SHALL notify all connected applications of the failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want profile changes to persist across all my open application tabs, so that my experience is consistent everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change my theme in one application THEN all other open application tabs SHALL immediately update to the new theme
2. WHEN I update my display name THEN all applications SHALL immediately show the updated name in user interface elements
3. WHEN I upload a new avatar THEN all applications SHALL immediately display the new avatar image
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN changes SHALL be queued and synchronized when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I have a reliable experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the popup window is closed unexpectedly THEN the parent application SHALL continue to function normally
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur in the popup THEN the parent application SHALL not be affected
3. WHEN the profile service is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN browser storage is full or unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on mobile devices, I want the profile interface to work well on smaller screens, so that I can manage my profile regardless of device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the profile on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL detect the screen size and adapt the interface accordingly
2. WHEN popup windows are not well-supported on mobile THEN the system SHALL use a full-screen overlay or modal instead
3. WHEN I rotate my mobile device THEN the profile interface SHALL adapt to the new orientation
4. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN all profile controls SHALL be appropriately sized and responsive
