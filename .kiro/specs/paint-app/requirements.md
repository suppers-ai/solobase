# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Paint application is a web-based drawing tool that allows users to create digital artwork through an intuitive interface. Users can draw on a white canvas using customizable pencil tools, select different colors, adjust pencil width, and insert images into their artwork. The application follows the same architectural patterns as the existing Recorder application, providing a seamless user experience within the Suppers platform.
