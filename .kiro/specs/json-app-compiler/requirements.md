# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Deno Fresh monorepo system that can generate complete applications from JSON configuration files. The system will consist of multiple packages working together: a compiler that reads JSON specifications, a UI library providing reusable components, an API layer, shared utilities, and template structures. The compiler will interpret JSON descriptions and assemble applications by combining components from the UI library with the appropriate API integrations and shared functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define application structure and components in a JSON file, so that I can generate complete applications without writing boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON configuration file is provided THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the JSON structure
2. WHEN the JSON contains application metadata THEN the system SHALL extract app name, version, and description
3. WHEN the JSON contains component definitions THEN the system SHALL identify required UI components and their properties
4. WHEN the JSON contains routing information THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate route structures
5. IF the JSON structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with line numbers and validation details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a compiler that can read JSON specifications and generate Deno Fresh applications, so that I can automate application scaffolding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the compiler processes a JSON file THEN it SHALL create a complete Deno Fresh project structure
2. WHEN generating applications THEN the compiler SHALL use Deno and fresh 2.0 features and syntax
3. WHEN copying template files THEN the compiler SHALL replace placeholders with values from the JSON configuration
4. WHEN integrating UI components THEN the compiler SHALL import and configure components from the UI library
5. WHEN generating API routes THEN the compiler SHALL create appropriate handlers based on JSON specifications
6. IF template files are missing THEN the compiler SHALL report specific missing dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive UI library with reusable components, so that the compiler can assemble applications from standardized building blocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI library is imported THEN it SHALL provide a catalog of available components
2. WHEN components are requested THEN the library SHALL return Fresh-compatible island components
3. WHEN components have configurable properties THEN the library SHALL accept and validate prop configurations
4. WHEN components require styling THEN the library SHALL include appropriate CSS or styling solutions
5. WHEN new components are added THEN the library SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing JSON schemas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an API package that provides backend functionality, so that generated applications can handle data operations and business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes are generated THEN they SHALL follow Deno Fresh routing conventions
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the API SHALL provide CRUD operations based on JSON specifications
3. WHEN processing data THEN the API SHALL validate inputs using shared type definitions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the API SHALL return consistent error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the API SHALL integrate with configurable auth providers

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared types and utilities across all packages, so that the monorepo maintains consistency and reduces code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packages need common types THEN they SHALL import from the shared package
2. WHEN JSON schemas are defined THEN they SHALL be available to all packages for validation
3. WHEN utility functions are needed THEN they SHALL be centralized in the shared package
4. WHEN types change THEN all dependent packages SHALL maintain type safety
5. IF shared dependencies are updated THEN all packages SHALL remain compatible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want template structures that the compiler can copy and customize, so that generated applications follow consistent patterns and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating new applications THEN the compiler SHALL copy from predefined templates
2. WHEN templates contain placeholders THEN they SHALL be replaced with JSON configuration values
3. WHEN templates include configuration files THEN they SHALL be customized for the target application
4. WHEN Fresh framework updates occur THEN templates SHALL be updated to maintain compatibility
5. IF custom templates are provided THEN the compiler SHALL validate and use them instead of defaults

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the monorepo to use Deno and fresh 2.0 features, so that the system leverages the latest Deno and Fresh capabilities and performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the monorepo THEN it SHALL use Deno and Fresh 2.0 as the runtime
2. WHEN managing dependencies THEN it SHALL use Deno's native package management
3. WHEN building applications THEN it SHALL leverage Deno performance optimizations
4. WHEN running development servers THEN it SHALL use Deno's built-in development tools
5. IF Deno features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback implementations
