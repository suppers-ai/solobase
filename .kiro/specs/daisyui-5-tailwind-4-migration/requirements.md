# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the entire UI library from DaisyUI 4 to DaisyUI 5 and Tailwind CSS 3 to Tailwind CSS 4. The migration needs to ensure all components use the latest recommended approaches, classes, and patterns while maintaining backward compatibility and functionality. The UI library contains 162 component files across multiple categories (action, auth, display, feedback, input, layout, mockup, navigation, page, sections) that need to be systematically updated.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the UI library, I want all components to work correctly with DaisyUI 5 and Tailwind 4, so that I can use the latest features and improvements without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any UI component is rendered THEN it SHALL use DaisyUI 5 compatible classes and patterns
2. WHEN any UI component uses Tailwind classes THEN it SHALL use Tailwind 4 compatible syntax and features
3. WHEN existing applications use the UI library THEN they SHALL continue to function without breaking changes
4. WHEN components use color classes THEN they SHALL use DaisyUI 5 semantic color tokens instead of hardcoded values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the UI library, I want a systematic approach to identify and update deprecated classes and patterns, so that the migration is comprehensive and nothing is missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing component files THEN the system SHALL identify all DaisyUI 4 specific classes that need updating
2. WHEN analyzing component files THEN the system SHALL identify all Tailwind 3 specific classes that need updating
3. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL document what changes were made and why
4. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL be tested to ensure functionality is preserved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the UI library, I want all component schemas and TypeScript types to be compatible with the updated components, so that I get proper type safety and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component props change due to DaisyUI 5 updates THEN the corresponding Zod schemas SHALL be updated
2. WHEN component interfaces change THEN the TypeScript types SHALL be updated accordingly
3. WHEN schema validation runs THEN it SHALL pass for all updated components
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation runs THEN it SHALL complete without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with the UI library, I want comprehensive documentation of the migration changes, so that I understand what has changed and how to adapt my code if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN there SHALL be documentation of all breaking changes
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN there SHALL be a migration guide for developers
3. WHEN components are updated THEN their metadata and examples SHALL reflect the new patterns
4. WHEN new DaisyUI 5 features are available THEN components SHALL be enhanced to use them where appropriate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the UI library, I want all components to follow consistent patterns and best practices for DaisyUI 5 and Tailwind 4, so that the library feels cohesive and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components use similar functionality THEN they SHALL use consistent DaisyUI 5 patterns
2. WHEN components handle theming THEN they SHALL use DaisyUI 5 theme system consistently
3. WHEN components use responsive design THEN they SHALL use Tailwind 4 responsive patterns
4. WHEN components use animations or transitions THEN they SHALL use DaisyUI 5 and Tailwind 4 recommended approaches
