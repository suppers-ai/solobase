# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dashboard package is a minimalist web application that serves as the central hub for users to create and manage their applications within the Suppers platform. This dashboard will provide a clean, focused interface for application lifecycle management while maintaining consistency with the existing platform architecture and design system.
