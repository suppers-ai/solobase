# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to dramatically simplify the component metadata system in the UI library documentation. The current system is overly complex with multiple rendering approaches (`staticRender`, `code`, `showCode`) that make it confusing to maintain and understand. We want to streamline this to a single, consistent approach where examples are defined purely through props, and code display is automatic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining component documentation, I want a simplified metadata structure so that I can easily add and update component examples without dealing with complex rendering logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define a component example THEN I SHALL only need to provide title, description, and props
2. WHEN I create component metadata THEN the system SHALL automatically render the component using the provided props
3. WHEN I view a component page THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and display the JSX code based on the props
4. WHEN I remove staticRender, code, and showCode properties THEN existing component examples SHALL still work with the new simplified approach

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer viewing component documentation, I want consistent example presentation so that I can easily understand how to use each component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any component example THEN I SHALL see the rendered component followed by automatically generated code
2. WHEN I view the code section THEN it SHALL show clean JSX syntax based on the props provided in metadata
3. WHEN props include complex objects or functions THEN the generated code SHALL display them in a readable format
4. WHEN I view multiple examples for a component THEN they SHALL all follow the same consistent presentation pattern

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the component route handler, I want simplified rendering logic so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the route handler processes an example THEN it SHALL only need to handle the props-based rendering approach
2. WHEN generating JSX code THEN the system SHALL convert props back to readable JSX syntax
3. WHEN handling different prop types THEN the system SHALL properly format strings, booleans, numbers, objects, and functions in the generated code
4. WHEN removing complex parsing logic THEN the route handler SHALL be significantly shorter and more maintainable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer migrating existing component metadata, I want a clear migration path so that I can update all components to use the new simplified structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I identify components using the old metadata structure THEN I SHALL have a clear list of what needs to be updated
2. WHEN I convert staticRender examples THEN I SHALL extract the equivalent props that produce the same visual result
3. WHEN I convert code-based examples THEN I SHALL parse the JSX to extract the props being used
4. WHEN I remove showCode properties THEN the system SHALL automatically show code for all examples by default
