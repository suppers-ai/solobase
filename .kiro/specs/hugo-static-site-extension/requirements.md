# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hugo Static Site Extension will enable users to create, build, and host static websites directly within the solobase platform. This extension leverages Hugo, a popular static site generator, and integrates with the existing packages/storage system to provide seamless website hosting capabilities. Users will be able to upload Hugo source files, trigger builds, and serve the generated static content through the solobase infrastructure.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide a fully integrated Hugo static site generator within solobase
- Enable administrators to create and manage multiple Hugo sites
- Leverage existing solobase storage and authentication systems
- Offer a user-friendly interface for non-technical users
- Support custom domains and themes
- Ensure security through proper permission controls

### Non-Goals
- Replace existing solobase functionality
- Support other static site generators (Jekyll, Gatsby, etc.)
- Provide external CI/CD integration
- Offer serverless functions or dynamic backend features
- Support real-time collaborative editing
