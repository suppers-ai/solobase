# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for rewriting the existing Deno-based formulapricing-site application to a Go-based web application. The goal is to create a pixel-perfect replica of the current application using Go, maintaining all visual elements, interactive features, and functionality while leveraging the existing Go project architecture patterns from the dufflebagbase project.

The current application is a marketing/documentation site for Formula Pricing, featuring an interactive Professor Gopher character with eye-tracking functionality, responsive design, and modern web styling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see the exact same visual design and layout as the current Deno application, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display the same hero section with background pattern and navigation
2. WHEN a user views the page THEN the system SHALL render the same typography, colors, and spacing as the original
3. WHEN a user interacts with buttons THEN the system SHALL show the same hover effects and styling
4. WHEN a user views the page on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same responsive behavior
5. WHEN a user sees the feature cards THEN the system SHALL display them with identical styling and animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the Professor Gopher character to have interactive eyes that follow my mouse cursor, so that I have the same engaging experience as the original site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves their mouse cursor THEN the Professor Gopher's eyes SHALL track the cursor movement
2. WHEN the cursor moves to different positions THEN both eyes SHALL rotate independently to look at the cursor
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the Professor Gopher image SHALL be displayed with properly positioned eye sockets
4. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the Professor Gopher SHALL still display correctly without eye tracking
5. WHEN the eye tracking calculates angles THEN the system SHALL use the same mathematical calculations as the original

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want all navigation links and buttons to work correctly, so that I can access the intended functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on navigation links THEN the system SHALL handle the routing appropriately
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Live Demo" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the demo section or page
3. WHEN a user clicks "Read the documentation" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the documentation
4. WHEN a user clicks the GitHub icon THEN the system SHALL open the GitHub repository
5. WHEN a user clicks footer links THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the search functionality in the navigation to work properly, so that I can find relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search input THEN the system SHALL accept and process the input
2. WHEN a user submits a search THEN the system SHALL handle the search request appropriately
3. WHEN the search input is focused THEN the system SHALL show the same visual feedback as the original
4. WHEN the search input loses focus THEN the system SHALL maintain proper styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Go application to follow the same architectural patterns as the existing dufflebagbase project, so that it maintains consistency with the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL use the same directory layout as dufflebagbase
2. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL use the templ library for HTML generation
3. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be organized in the static/ directory
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL use Gorilla Mux for routing like dufflebagbase
5. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL use the same config patterns as dufflebagbase

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all static assets (CSS, images, JavaScript) to be properly served and organized, so that the application functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static CSS files are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them with correct MIME types
2. WHEN the Professor Gopher image is requested THEN the system SHALL serve it from the static directory
3. WHEN background SVG patterns are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them correctly
4. WHEN JavaScript files are requested THEN the system SHALL serve them with proper headers
5. WHEN assets are organized THEN they SHALL follow the same structure as the original application

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the 404 error page to display the same design and functionality as the original, so that error handling is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a non-existent page THEN the system SHALL display the 404 error page
2. WHEN the 404 page is shown THEN it SHALL have the same styling and layout as the original
3. WHEN a user clicks "Go Home" on the 404 page THEN they SHALL be redirected to the homepage
4. WHEN the 404 page loads THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual hierarchy as the original

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be easily deployable and maintainable, so that it can be integrated into the existing infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL compile to a single binary executable
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL log startup information and errors appropriately
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL be compatible with the existing deployment patterns
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL use Go modules with proper versioning
