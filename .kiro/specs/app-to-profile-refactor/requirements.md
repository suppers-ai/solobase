# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing "app" package to a "profile" package to better reflect its purpose as a user profile and SSO authentication service. The current "app" package contains OAuth 2.0 endpoints, user authentication flows, and profile management functionality that should be renamed and reorganized to clearly indicate its role as a profile/SSO service within the Suppers ecosystem.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package name to accurately reflect its functionality, so that the codebase is more maintainable and the purpose of each package is clear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the package SHALL be renamed from "app" to "profile"
2. WHEN the package is renamed THEN all internal references SHALL be updated to use the new package name
3. WHEN the package is renamed THEN all import statements in other packages SHALL be updated to reference the new package name
4. WHEN the package is renamed THEN the package.json/deno.json SHALL reflect the new package name "@suppers/profile"

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all file paths and directory references to be updated consistently, so that the application continues to function correctly after the refactor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files reference the old package path THEN they SHALL be updated to reference the new "packages/profile" path
2. WHEN configuration files reference the old package THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new package name
3. WHEN documentation references the old package name THEN it SHALL be updated to reflect the new "profile" package
4. WHEN build scripts reference the old package THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new package path

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package's README and documentation to reflect its focused purpose, so that new team members understand what the package does.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL clearly describe the package as a "Profile & SSO Authentication Service"
2. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL remove any generic "app" references and focus on profile/SSO functionality
3. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL maintain all technical documentation about OAuth endpoints and authentication flows
4. WHEN the README is updated THEN it SHALL update example URLs and references to use the new package name

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want environment variables and configuration to be updated appropriately, so that deployment and configuration remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables reference the old package THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect the new package purpose
2. WHEN configuration files contain package-specific settings THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new package name
3. WHEN deployment scripts reference the old package THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new package path
4. WHEN the package port configuration is updated THEN it SHALL use a profile-specific port (e.g., 8002 instead of 8001)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on other packages, I want all cross-package dependencies to be updated automatically, so that the system continues to work without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other packages import from the old "app" package THEN they SHALL be updated to import from the new "profile" package
2. WHEN other packages reference the old package in configuration THEN they SHALL be updated to reference the new package
3. WHEN scripts reference the old package path THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new package path
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all packages SHALL build and run successfully with the new package name

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the core functionality to remain unchanged during the refactor, so that existing authentication and profile features continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all OAuth 2.0 endpoints SHALL continue to function identically
2. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN user authentication flows SHALL work without changes
3. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN profile management features SHALL remain fully functional
4. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all existing API contracts SHALL be maintained
